                The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco,
                California. The band consists a dynamic lineup featuring two lead
                vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a keyboardist and a drummer. The
                band achieved its first commercial success as an unsigned act, drawing
                attention from their future manager. Having extensive experience
                working with both new and seasoned acts, the manager was confident the
                band could succeed even further with more support, pushing The Bees
                Knees to sign with a well known record label.

                  From there, the band has
                  soared, gaining international recognition and ranking in the top 10 on
                  the Poster Charts. New fans immediately fell in love with the band’s
                  original and organic attitude, solidifying their place as one of the
                  hottest and fastest up and coming acts of this century. Fans
                  affectionately refer to themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to
                  their candid and authentic performances on stage. The Bees Knees are
                  currently recording their second studio album, looking to be released
                  in early 2024.
